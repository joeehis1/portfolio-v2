# portfolio-v2

This repository includes code for my portfolio website. I built another website like this but this version is more javascript heavy.

This version is based on a design which I created with heavy inspiration from my css mentor Kevin Powell. See link: https://www.figma.com/file/VL3hWBdECw5iZFDZgylXq3/Untitled?type=design&t=vLHZxRoUe35lTu5y-6. I made some last minute changes that are not reflected in the design file.

CSS done using sass for convenience.
